This application is a simple way to create and organize your favorite color palettes.  Sets of colors are easily viewable in a clean interface.  Edit them, rearrange them, create new sets, make them your own.  Cross-platform using [Adobe's AIR technology](http://labs.adobe.com/downloads/air.html).

Basically it's something I wanted for myself, so I made it. Brought to you by Levitation Designs, which happens to be just me.  Come and visit me, though I'll warn you that the site is definitely a work in progress:
